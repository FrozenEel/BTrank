# BTrank

BTrank is a lightweight appearance evaluation app designed for entertainment and personal curiosity. The app allows users to input various attributes such as appearance, body, outfit, temperament, makeup level, and filter intensity, and generates a score based on a scientifically smooth ranking algorithm. The ranking system uses logarithmic smoothing and normalized log scaling to prevent extreme score fluctuations.

This app is for entertainment purposes only. The scores generated by the system do not reflect objective or professional standards of appearance. Please use the app responsibly and in good humor.
